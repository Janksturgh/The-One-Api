    <h3>About The Typography</h3>
    <p>Assuming the root html font size is 18px we are using rem for font sizing through the website components</p>
    <p>To check what font size is being used on the root html element of your project check in the computed tab on your dev tools</p>
    <p>Font being used is Barlow which is hosted on Google fonts</p>
    <p>Heading sizes and weights are in the typography.scss file with easily reusable mixins using design system based font styles - with the exception of not using gotham</p>
